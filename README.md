"Meat by Weight" Project

Project Description

"Meat by Weight" is a web application that functions as a meat store, allowing customers to browse, order meat products, rate and review the store. On the other side, the application enables administrators to manage store products, review and mark orders as completed, and view user reviews. The application has been built using technologies such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, JSP, JavaScript, Maven, and CSS.
